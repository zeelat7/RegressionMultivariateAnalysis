qqPlot(model.1)

# Note that this is not the typical QQ plot.  Also note that the Studentized residuals
# have a different distribution than the standard residuals.


# Cook's Distance Plot
influenceIndexPlot(model.1,vars=c('Cook','hat'))

# Note that the x index is not correct.  They are the row labels from the original
# data frame.

rownames(train.df) <- seq(1,length(model.1$residuals),1)
model.1 <- lm(SalePrice ~ TotalSqftCalc, data=train.df)
influenceIndexPlot(model.1,vars=c('Cook','hat'))

# If we want the labels correct, then we have to go back to the original data frame
# and fix the row names, then refit the model, and then call the plot.
